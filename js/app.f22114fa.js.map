I tried to get around it once, but the system was coming back to normal after about 2 hours anyway, so I didn't want to bother with it during hackathon.

In addition, the problem is that new versions of Android like to save energy, so I had to keep it to a minimum to make this functionality work in such a short time. After previous experience with Android’s JetPack, I decided to use WorkManager and stick to the minimum interval of work in the background (every 15 minutes). I tried to get around it once, but the system was coming back to normal after about 2 hours anyway, so I didn't want to bother with it during hackathon. As far as location is concerned, I decided to stick to downloading the last known location instead of firing gps and looking for a new one.
